================================================================

Howdy,

You're here cause you wanna play video ma games but don't wanna pay for dat shit, me too.
This is a program that will allow you play games from your friends libraries even though 
they're online also.

F.Y.I - the program does request to make changes ( this prompt is needed inorder to run
SteamBlockButBetter at an elevated level which inturn is required to make firewall rules to block steam)

Set-up [
	+ make sure you have python installed 
	+ Create a shortcut wherever you want to the python file "SteamBlock2.py" inside "NewBlock"
	+ if its you first time running the program you might need to start a second time ( from then on
	  out should work on first start )
       ]

Requirements [
	+ Single player and most Lan multiplayer games
	+ Before you enable the block through the menu ensure the library is available since
	  steam saves weather or not the library was availbe before the block starts ( this 
	  means that if they are getting on or already on just request that they hop off for
	  a moment so that you can enable the block and then both can now play on said library )
	     ]

Troublshooting [
	+ If the program is closing on you randomly this might be because of one of a couple of errors
	  that I have not yet set-up a display error for yet ( this will hopefully come in the future
	+ If the menu says its enabled but its still not working go through the menu and select delete rule
	  and go back through the menu and enable the rule ( another issue could be you not giving your system
	  enough time to update that the library is available give it a minute and make sure you can see on steam
	  that the library is availbe before running the block ) 
               ]
